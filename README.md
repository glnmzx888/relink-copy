# relink-copy
A copy of the original ReLink Tool and Data by Wu et al. [1]. The [link](http://bugcenter.googlecode.com/files/ReLink.zip) on the [homepage shared](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~scc/ReLink.htm) in the paper to the data is currently broken, this is a (hopefully complete) local copy I had of the data.

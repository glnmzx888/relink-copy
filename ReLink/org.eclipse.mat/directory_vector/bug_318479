missing icons for rcp and features. null the product icons for memory analyzer in the top left of the window title bar and with alt-tab with windows operating system and on the bottom of the screen are quite jagged. this is possibly because the icons in  org.eclipse.mat.rcp mat.product only declares a 16x16 icon.  a higher resolution icon would be useful.  it would also be nice to have platform icons for the executable.  the features need icons too - for the  org.eclipse.mat.chart.feature -&gt; org.eclipse.mat.chart as the branding plugin org.eclipse.mat.feature -&gt; org.eclipse.mat.api as the branding plugin org.eclipse.mat.rcp.feature -&gt; org.eclipse.mat.ui.rcp as the branding plugin  about.ini featureimage=xxxx i've made a 32x32 memory_analyzer_32.gif icon by stretching the 16x16 icon, then tidying it up.  i'll try that for the rcp. i've added that icon to rcp: via  about.ini  plugin.xml  mat.product api: via  about.ini chart: via  about.ini  also to the mat.product project used for tycho/maven i've done all i want to. i haven't added any platform specific icons. 318479 318479 318479 318479

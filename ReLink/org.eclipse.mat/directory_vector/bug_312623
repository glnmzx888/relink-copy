rcp solaris x86_64. null please provide a rcp bundle for rcp solaris x86[_64] (not only for sparc). since galileo solaris x86 is officially supported, so it shouldn't be a problem.  btw: since sparc is more or less obsolete for desktops, one should expect, that x86 is much more important than sparc wrt. development... i added two new configurations for building rcps: linux,gtk,ppc64 and solaris,gtk,x86. theses rcps should be available for download at the beginning of next week. the new rcps are available at <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mat/downloads.php">http://www.eclipse.org/mat/downloads.php</a>  the rcps are for linux,gtk,ppc64 and solaris,gtk,x86.  despite the title of this report &quot;rcp solaris x86_64&quot; there is no support for solaris,gtk,x86_64, only for solarris,gtk,x86. the current bundle (<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/mat/latest/rcp/memoryanalyzer-.-solaris.gtk.x86.zip">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/mat/latest/rcp/memoryanalyzer-.-solaris.gtk.x86.zip</a>) does not work out of the box:  to get it work, i copied eclipse-gtk-/plugins/org.eclipse.swt.gtk.solaris.x86_.2.v3557f.jar to mat/plugins/ and added the following sections to:  --- mat/features/org.eclipse.mat.dependencies.feature_./feature.xml.orig                                                                                                           thu may 20 11:32:38 2010 +++ mat/features/org.eclipse.mat.dependencies.feature_./feature.xml                                                                                                                tue jun  1 15:52:03 2010 &#64;&#64; -191,6 +191,17 &#64;&#64;           unpack=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;      &lt;plugin +         id=&quot;org.eclipse.swt.gtk.solaris.x86&quot; +         os=&quot;solaris&quot; +         ws=&quot;gtk&quot; +         arch=&quot;x86&quot; +         download-size=&quot;0&quot; +         install-size=&quot;0&quot; +         version=&quot;.2.v3557f&quot; +         fragment=&quot;true&quot; +         unpack=&quot;false&quot;/&gt; + +   &lt;plugin           id=&quot;org.eclipse.swt.gtk.linux.ppc&quot;           os=&quot;linux&quot;           ws=&quot;gtk&quot; &#64;&#64; -326,6 +337,16 &#64;&#64;           arch=&quot;sparc&quot;           download-size=&quot;0&quot;           install-size=&quot;0&quot; +         version=&quot;.200.v20090519&quot; +         fragment=&quot;true&quot;/&gt; + +   &lt;plugin +         id=&quot;org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.gtk.solaris.x86&quot; +         os=&quot;solaris&quot; +         ws=&quot;gtk&quot; +         arch=&quot;x86&quot; +         download-size=&quot;0&quot; +         install-size=&quot;0&quot;           version=&quot;.200.v20090519&quot;           fragment=&quot;true&quot;/&gt; thanks for the feedback and the patch. i just wanted to give you a short update on this bug - we are currently working on a bugfix release (. . a working rcp for solaris x86 should be one of the changes in it. however, we'll try to build the rcps with  and i may need to modify the version numbers in the patch you proposed.  is fine - already upgraded our eclipse installations to . at least for me the version numbers in the patch do not matter - just used the ones from the  packages i found.  thanx for your work, jel. at the end we went back to building the rcps for .1 against a  eclipse. i have added only one of the &lt;plugin&gt; fragments which you suggested, i.e. modified your patch to:  index: feature.xml =================================================================== --- feature.xml    (revision   +++ feature.xml    (revision   &#64;&#64; -176,7 +176,18 &#64;&#64;           version=&quot;.0&quot;           fragment=&quot;true&quot;           unpack=&quot;false&quot;/&gt; - +          +   &lt;plugin +         id=&quot;org.eclipse.swt.gtk.solaris.x86&quot; +         os=&quot;solaris&quot; +         ws=&quot;gtk&quot; +         arch=&quot;x86&quot; +         download-size=&quot;0&quot; +         install-size=&quot;0&quot; +         version=&quot;.0&quot; +         fragment=&quot;true&quot; +         unpack=&quot;false&quot;/&gt; +           the generated rcp already contains the org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.gtk.solaris.x86 which your second &lt;plugin&gt; fragment was adding.  i set the ip log flag on the message to have your contribution recorded.  the changes to the xml i made in  /branches/.x, revision 875 - this is where the service release for  will come from /trunk, revision 876  i have already the rcps which i believe are the release ones, but haven't uploaded them yet. will you be so nice to test the rcp for solaris x86 in the next days before we publish the links on our web site. if you have the time for this, i'll give you the link once the content is there.

remember custom jdk that is set for acquire heap dump. null build identifier: eclipse memory analyzer version .0  currently the jdkhome property is always reset, this means users that need to use a different jdk for heap dump retrieval need to always enter the different one, it would be more user friendly to have the last custom jdk remembered for this field as you typically do a number of memory dumps of the same application during memory analysis.  i typically have to set a different jdk when my &quot;system under analysis&quot; is running with 32-bit, whereas mat is executed with 64-bit (necessary to have more memory available than 2g).  reproducible: always  steps to reproduce: 1. acquire a heap dump where you set the jdkhome to a different value 2. acquire another heap dump, the jdkhome property is reset to the default value instead of the value you just entered before i checked in some changes which solve the problem. previously only the user setting for the jdk used to get the list of jvms was saved and this was reused for calling jmap. it was possible to choose another vm for jmap but this specific setting wasn't saved. now both of them are saved as separate properties.  the change will be included in the next bugfix release, which i (tentatively) see in about a month. until then as a workaround for your problem you can use the &quot;configure&quot; button on the first page and set there the jdkhome used to get the list of vms to the x32 one. as i said this one is used then to call jmap.

remove o.e.platform branding bundle. null currently mat ships with the org.eclipse.platform bundle which is essential the branding bundle for the eclipse sdk. it contains many unneeded files for the mat rcp version (sdk intro, cvs cheatsheets, icons, splash screens, etc). besides that this is unnecessary, it carries broken things if not part of the sdk (eg. the cvs cheatsheets do not work without cvs bundles). the only interesting thing in that bundle is the definition of the cheatsheet action set which should be transfered to the org.eclipse.mat.ui.rcp bundle. thanks for the hint. i would unfortunately need some more explanation. i checked the dependencies of org.eclipse.mat.ui.rcp and see there the platform as you mentioned.   1st attempt) i tried then removing it - everything compiles, but the cheetsheets don't come up. 2nd attempt) i tried then to copy (just as it is) the following actionsets definition     &lt;extension          point=&quot;org.eclipse.ui.actionsets&quot;&gt;       &lt;actionset             label=&quot;%cheatsheet.actionset&quot;             visible=&quot;true&quot;             id=&quot;org.eclipse.ui.cheatsheets.actionset&quot;&gt;          &lt;action                label=&quot;%cheatsheet.item&quot;                class=&quot;org.eclipse.ui.cheatsheets.cheatsheetextensionfactory:helpmenuaction&quot;                menubarpath=&quot;help/group.tutorials&quot;                id=&quot;org.eclipse.ui.cheatsheets.actions.cheatsheethelpmenuaction&quot;&gt;          &lt;/action&gt;       &lt;/actionset&gt;    &lt;/extension&gt;  this also didn't help: wneh i try to open a cheetsheet i get: &quot;no standby content part defined with id: org.eclipse.platform.cheatsheet.&quot;  3rd attempt) wanted to also copy the following    &lt;extension point=&quot;org.eclipse.ui.intro.configextension&quot;&gt;       &lt;standbycontentpart             id=&quot;org.eclipse.platform.cheatsheet&quot;             class=&quot;org.eclipse.platform.internal.cheatsheetstandbycontent&quot;             pluginid=&quot;org.eclipse.platform&quot;/&gt;             ... but it already points to some class within the platform bundle.   at this moment i'd prefer to ask for more hints, as i'm afraid i'm not doing the right thing and haven't really understood your suggestion. what did you mean by  <span class="quote">&gt;&gt; the definition of the cheatsheet action set which should be transfered to the org.eclipse.mat.ui.rcp bundle</span > created <span class=""><a href="attachment.cgi?id=173215&amp;action=diff" name="attach_173215" title="patch">attachment 173215</a> <a href="attachment.cgi?id=173215&amp;action=edit" title="patch">[details]</a></span> patch  this patch includes the changes i suggested. when running mat from the product file, everything looks fine to me (menu item is there, can open the mat cheatsheets).  btw: i think the cheatsheets itself should be moved to the help bundle + the dependency to o.e.ui.cheatsheets the patch works as advertised, so i'll include it and the tycho/maven build should show a cheat sheets page without cvs. i now see the problem that krum had. the cheat sheets work from help -&gt; cheat sheets but not from the welcome page, which fails with &quot;&quot;no standby content part defined with id: org.eclipse.platform.cheatsheet.&quot;  the cheatsheetstandbycontent class can be copied from org.eclipse.platform into o.e.mat.ui, then we can have our own standby content instead of needing o.e.platform bundle. the intro tutorial xml need to be modified to change url=&quot;<a href="http://org.eclipse.ui.intro/showstandby?partid=org.eclipse.platform.cheatsheet&amp;amp;input=org.eclipse.mat.tutorials.bestfeaturestutorial">http://org.eclipse.ui.intro/showstandby?partid=org.eclipse.platform.cheatsheet&amp;amp;input=org.eclipse.mat.tutorials.bestfeaturestutorial</a>&quot;&gt;   to point to our version of the standby partid. i've made the changes in the patch, created our own copy of cheatsheetstandbycontent and associated extension in org.eclipse.mat.ui, moved the cheat sheets to the org.eclipse.mat.ui.help plugin, adjusted the build properties to ensure they are still packaged.

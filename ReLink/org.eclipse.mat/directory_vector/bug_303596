avoid corruptdataexception when opening truncated javacore. null a truncated javacore file can be parsed, but not opened as finding the address space from the javaruntime fails.  the fix is to return the imageaddressspace, imageprocess and javaruntime together when opening a dump. simplify the dtfj adapter to return all three dtfj objects on opening a dump. now fixed as described. (corrupt data exception ) (java runtime ) (image address space ) (image process ) (java runtime ) 303596 303596 303596 303596

configurable queries for java collections: hash entries and extract hash set values. null created <span class=""><a href="attachment.cgi?id=126875&amp;action=diff" name="attach_126875" title="make the queries configurable and allow for null tables">attachment 126875</a> <a href="attachment.cgi?id=126875&amp;action=edit" title="make the queries configurable and allow for null tables">[details]</a></span> make the queries configurable and allow for null tables  these queries use known values for the array fields and key/value fields.  they could be made configurable for non-standard hash maps and hash sets.  also on some ibm dumps an empty hashmap can have a null table. the current query fails which is annoying if the query is done on a whole group of hashmaps. thanks andrew! i added one more check (not only to your query) because i noticed that getclassesbyname can return null (and not only an empty list) (hash map ) (hash maps ) 266348 266348 266348 266348

bad mat://object/ link goes to blank page. null if there is a bad mat://object/ link in a report then a warning message  unable to map address 0x985b8 to an object on the heap.  appears, but then it changes to a page saying:  the page cannot be displayed  the page you are looking for might have been removed or had its name changed.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  and the back button is needed to get back to the report.  bad links shouldn't occur, but are possible with user written queries or by opening an report from an unrelated dump. the problem is that the error messages doesn't stop the jump to the new page. clearing event.doit in querytextresultpane should fix it. i've changed querytextresultpane to set event.doit to false after the error.

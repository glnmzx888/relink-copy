closing a heap dump view does not close all index files. null hi all, when i close the view for a heap dump it seems not all index files are closed.  when i try to delete the hprof index files i got the following messages :  c:\workspace\observer1\java_pid2280_1.temp.a2s.index the process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process. c:\workspace\observer1\java_pid2280_1.temp.outbound.index the process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.  regards, markus created <span class=""><a href="attachment.cgi?id=96448" name="attach_96448" title="patch closing all index readers">attachment 96448</a> <a href="attachment.cgi?id=96448&amp;action=edit" title="patch closing all index readers">[details]</a></span> patch closing all index readers  markus,  it looks like the problem occurs only if you just parsed the heap dump, right? (for this, i have attached a patch if you want to test)  if the heap dump is already parsed in a previous mat run, then opened and closed in a new session, index files can be deleted without problems. does this work for you?  andreas.

use jars. null +++ this bug was initially created as a clone of <span class="bz_closed"><a href="show_bug.cgi?id=252800" title="resolved fixed - use jars">bug #252800</a></span> +++  projects must use jar'ed plug-ins (with unpack=false) unless authorized by the planning council for technical reasons. nested jars should be avoided if possible since it creates problems for projects that has dependencies to such plug-ins. the osgi runtime is fine with it but the compiler is not able to handle classpaths that contain nested jars. in case only one nested jar exists, it is often better to expand the contents of that jar into the root folder (i.e. unnest the jar). if a plug-in contains large files that are frequently used (opened and closed), a jar'ed plug-in might degrade performance significantly since the file must be decompressed each time it is opened. this is relevant for our help plug-in which in turn contains the sample heap dump. org.eclipse.mat.ui.help is now packed in jar. sample heap dump, located in this plug-in, will be extracted to the &lt;workspace&gt;\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.mat.ui\heapdump folder (os gi ) 257885 257885 257885 257885

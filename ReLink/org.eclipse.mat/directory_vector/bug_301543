no objects shown in top of stack. null the thread stack query doesn't show any objects in the top stack frame. minor fix - the stack parsing code was expecting the line to be &gt; 0, but the top stack frame has line=0:  thread 0x323903f0   at java.io.fileinputstream.readbytes([bii)i (native method)   at java.io.fileinputstream.read([bii)i (fileinputstream.java:    at java.io.bufferedinputstream.fill()v (bufferedinputstream.java:    at java.io.bufferedinputstream.read()i (bufferedinputstream.java:    at org.eclipse.mat.tests.createsampledump.main([ljava/lang/string;)v (createsampledump.java:     locals:     objecid=0x32391a88, line=0     objecid=0x32391a88, line=0     objecid=0x323932b8, line=1     objecid=0x323932c8, line=1     objecid=0x32392048, line=2     objecid=0x323932c8, line=2     objecid=0x32392048, line=3     objecid=0x32390338, line=4     objecid=0x32390348, line=4     objecid=0x32390318, line=4  this is a good opportunity to add some unit tests. changed line number test to &gt;= 0.

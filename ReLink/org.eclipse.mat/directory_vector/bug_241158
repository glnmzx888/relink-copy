the list of results for an oql. null build id: i20080617-2000  steps to reproduce: i'm using mat version .  the oql query results list displays 2 rows too many after executing a query with a lot of results, so they don't quite fit and i can't see the summary on the last line without scrolling.   more information: i can see the number of results displayed changes based on the size of the results list, so i believe the intention is to make the summary visible from the start. however i think the code doesn't account for the summary and filter lines so the results list ends up with a scrollbar anyway. looks like the calculation of visible rows does not work on vista. need to find a vista box to fix this. improved line height estimation on vista with cl 19447  i mark bug as fixed. next upload to the download server will contain fix.

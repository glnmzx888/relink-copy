enhancement request : save value to file for binary types. null created <span class=""><a href="attachment.cgi?id=114238" name="attach_114238" title="mat version">attachment 114238</a> <a href="attachment.cgi?id=114238&amp;action=edit" title="mat version">[details]</a></span> mat version  existing functionality: existing functionality: right click on object / primitive and save value to file. this works only for character types...  i have serialized objects in my heap dump and they are rather huge (25m). if i could save the byte[] to file, i could potentially de-serialize the object to understand the state. i need to be able to analyze how my serialized objects got that big in the first place and it should be a whole lot easier if i could retrieve the object state.  thanks, janardhan hi janardhan, i have changed the implementation of the &quot;save value to file&quot; context menu. if it is a primitive type (and if you select only one object) then it is written to a binary file which one can read using a java.io.datainputstream.  the change is submitted with cl 166. if you want to test it right now, either build mat from the repository or send me a short email and i can email you a patch.

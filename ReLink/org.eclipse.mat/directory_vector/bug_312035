copyright meta-data in the html documentatio pages generated by dita is wrong. null i figured out many of the copyright headers of the source files are outdated. i'll have a look and use the copyright tool [1] to fix any errors.  [1] <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/how_to_use_eclipse_copyright_tool">http://wiki.eclipse.org/how_to_use_eclipse_copyright_tool</a> i've updated the copyright statements for files in org.eclipse.mat.api that i know i've made changes to. the other files need the date changed. there might be a few that i've changed that i missed - i can add those later.  i've updated the copyright statements in org.eclipse.mat.dtfj + org.eclipse.mat.ibmdumps. i finished updating the copyright note to our source files.  i also added it to the .dita files in the help plugin.   one thing still bothers me - if i open the generated .html files i see inside the following metadata: &lt;meta name=&quot;copyright&quot; content=&quot;(c) copyright 2005&quot;/&gt; &lt;meta name=&quot;dc.rights.owner&quot; content=&quot;(c) copyright 2005&quot;/&gt;  i don't know currently how to replace the date with something meaningful. i 'll have to search for a way to do it. hints are welcome. i change the description to reflect the current state i added the following fragment to all our .dita files. after this the generated html files contain proper meta-data. i think now also the generated html pages are ok, and i'm closing the bug      &lt;prolog&gt;         &lt;copyright&gt;             &lt;copyryear year=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/copyryear&gt;             &lt;copyrholder&gt;                 copyright (c) 2008, 2010 sap ag and others.                 all rights reserved. this program and the accompanying materials                 are made available under the terms of the eclipse public license v                 which accompanies this distribution, and is available at                 <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html">http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html</a>             &lt;/copyrholder&gt;         &lt;/copyright&gt;     &lt;/prolog&gt; ( v ) ( 1 ) ( v ) ( 10 ) ( v ) ( 10 ) 312035 312035 312035 312035

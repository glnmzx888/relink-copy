support multiple heap dump formats. null the memory analyzer can support multiple heap dump formats such as hprof or dtfj. currently, however, only hprof is supported. this buzilla entry is used to track changes necessary in the core api to allow alternative formats. with cl 15039 this is addressed:  * allow multiple filters in the &quot;open heap dump&quot; dialog * add alternative heap dumps to the welcome page and history * additional throws clauses added to iindexbuilder and iobjectreader   open: * currently, the api assumes to get the content of primitive arrays as byte[]. however, the conversion from the raw bytes into the the correct primitive arrays (long[], char[], etc.) should be done by the heap dump adapter. created <span class=""><a href="attachment.cgi?id=96433" name="attach_96433" title="sample adpater">attachment 96433</a> <a href="attachment.cgi?id=96433&amp;action=edit" title="sample adpater">[details]</a></span> sample adpater  this is a sample dtfj adapter. it is not usable for analysis purposes as only arbitrarily selected data is displayed. ibm has published their dtfj adapter on alphaworks (<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/tools/mat.html">http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/tools/mat.html</a>) this is enough proof that the api works.

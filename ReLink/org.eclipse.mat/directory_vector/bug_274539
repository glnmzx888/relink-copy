overview pane is missing scroll bars. null the overview pane with the   details biggest objects by retained size actions   sections doesn't have scroll bars and if the size of the window is too small then information is hidden.  it isn't clear to a user that he must resize the whole of mat to get the actions section to be visible. changing  org.eclipse.mat.ui.snapshot.panes.overviewpane to use createscrolledform() instead of createform() does not fix it. the pane is then very wide with a scroll bar on the bottom but no scroll bar on the side. the fix is to use a scrolledform, tablewraplayout and tablewrapdata. the tablewraplayout has 3 columns and the tablewrapdata specifies which sections need to span 3 columns and which are in single columns.

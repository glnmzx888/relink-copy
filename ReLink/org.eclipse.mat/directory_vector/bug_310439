update documentation for . null before making the next release we need to review the documentation and make adjustments where necessary.  i am looking into this topic and will use this message to track the changes made. i have gone through the basic tutorial, concepts, and tasks sections of the documentation and made the following changes: - typo in the basic tutorial - modify heap dumps explanation not to be hprof specific - small changes to shallow size definition - small changes to the dominator tree page (wording) - enhanced the description how to get heap dumps - added sections for ibm dumps and also for the acquire functionality within mat - correction in &quot;analyzing classloaders&quot; to make vm agnostic. - updated screenshot and typo fixes in &quot;analyzing finalizers&quot; - enhanced the &quot;analyze threads&quot; section - added description for the thread stacks - updated screenshots and description on the &quot;export data&quot; page - provided more description what the immediate dominators is useful for in &quot;findresponsibleobjects.html&quot;  there is still the &quot;reference&quot; section to be reviewed. at first glance it seems to that this part needs much more rework than the others. i'll see how far i can get with this one for .  i will also need to do some more work on the new &amp; noteworthy document, as well as on the &quot;running leak suspects&quot; document.  andrew, can you look at the dtfj specific description in the acquire heap dump document? i did update some of the documentation under /reference plus the /tasks/runleaksuspects.html. i think i'm done with the changes which were reasonable to do for .  i'll leave the bug open for now in case there is some feedback on the changes. i've updated the acquire heap dump section. i've updated some text and links in org.eclipse.mat.ui tutorials. i've fixed the context help for the acquire heap dump wizard. i added the (missing) required legal notice to the documentation. see <a href="http://eclipse.org/legal/guidetolegaldoc.php">http://eclipse.org/legal/guidetolegaldoc.php</a> , . notices in documentation all changes to the documentation which were planned for the  release are already made. i close this ticket. 310439 310439 310439 310439

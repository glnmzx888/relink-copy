alignment of columns when doing copy/paste is hardcoded. null while trying to improve the copy functionality i found some problem - the alignment for the columns is hardcoded - the first column is left justified, and all the rest right justified. this works fine with all &quot;standard&quot; views in mat, but if i use oql to select  the address of an object and its value (say for strings) then the strings are right justified. this however would need a bit more thinking and therefore i opened a separate message for it.  how to reproduce:   open the oql view   execute  select s.&#64;objectaddress, tostring(s) from java.lang.string s    copy some lines from the result content and paste to a text file  the functionality is implemented in org.eclipse.mat.ui.util.copy i've got some code to fix this, and to follow reordering of columns in the gui,  and to get the dashed line the right length if the alignment of columns is not  the default.  i'll add it shortly. i'll commit my changes.  should the line separator be cr/lf or line.separator ?  should export as csv or html follow the reordering of table/tree columns? at the moment they do not.  krum, please try this and see if it does what you want. before:  s.&#64;objectaddress|                                              tostring(s)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 649,759,280     |                                           returnopentype  649,759,128     | javax.management.openmbean.openmbeanoperationinfosupport  649,757,024     | javax.management.openmbean.openmbeanparameterinfosupport  649,712,528     |                                          non-heap memory  649,712,472     |                                                 non_heap  649,712,408     |                                              heap memory  649,712,360     |                                                     heap  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  with the fix:   s.&#64;objectaddress |tostring(s) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------       649,759,280 |returnopentype       649,759,128 |javax.management.openmbean.openmbeanoperationinfosupport       649,757,024 |javax.management.openmbean.openmbeanparameterinfosupport       649,712,528 |non-heap memory       649,712,472 |non_heap       649,712,408 |heap memory --------------------------------------------------------------------------- (open m bean operation info support ) (open m bean parameter info support ) (open m bean operation info support ) (open m bean parameter info support ) 318559 318559 318559 318559

detect ability to read dump file based on file content. null in order to generate a heap dump i followed the directions from the jmap help, which gives the following example &quot;jmap -dump:format=b,file=heap.bin &lt;pid&gt;&quot;.  from this i got a file with the .bin extension which the mat failed at opening reporting that &quot;no parser was registered&quot;.  once i had renamed the extension into .hprof, mat opened the file without a problem.  to avoid this kind of annoyances, it could be good to detect the applicability of the parser based on the content of the file rather than the extension. the content type mechanism of the platform may be of use here. pascal, thanks for your input.  i will look into the extension point org.eclipse.core.contenttype.contenttypes. right now, it looks to me like one has to provide either &quot;file-extensions&quot; or &quot;file-names&quot;. when providing neither, the content type is never picked. therefore it looks like i have to know other possible extensions like &quot;bin&quot; or &quot;dmp&quot; anyway. added content types.  &quot;open file&quot; -&gt; opens heap dump for known extensions hprof, bin, dmp &quot;open heap dump&quot; -&gt; any extension (purely content based) resource navigator -&gt; &quot;open with...&quot; -&gt; any extension (purely content based) 235029 235029 235029 235029

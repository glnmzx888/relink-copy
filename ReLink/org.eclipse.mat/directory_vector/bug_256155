inspector: find primitive arrays with a constant value. null created <span class=""><a href="attachment.cgi?id=118505&amp;action=diff" name="attach_118505" title="code">attachment 118505</a> <a href="attachment.cgi?id=118505&amp;action=edit" title="code">[details]</a></span> code  find primitive arrays with a constant value this started with a more specific inspector that found swt image(data)s  that were blank. someone was create lots of images for a cache but never  actually using/drawing into them so they just wasted java heap. i realized  that the specific image inspector can be extrapolated into a general array  constant value inspector.  if i run this inspector across a recent heap i see mb wasted by the top  8 offenders. for example someone created a byte[] of size 880,256 but every  entry of that array has the same value. hi chris,  thanks for the patch!  i did some minor changes: * i removed the unused &quot;segments&quot; variable. * if no primitive arrays are found, i return an empty result. i though that just silently not opening a window and no message might leave the user confused.  i wonder: should we exclude primitive arrays with length = 1? such arrays will always have constant value.  andreas. thanks andreas. yes i think it makes sense to exclude primitive arrays with length 1. patch applied. :-) 256155 256155 256155 256155

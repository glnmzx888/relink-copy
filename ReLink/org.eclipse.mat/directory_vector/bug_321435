table header fonts too big for queries. null in the query wizard, some queries especially ones with an icon or file dialog button e.g. customized retained set or collection have column headers in a too large a font.  this was introduced by <span class="bz_closed"><a href="show_bug.cgi?id=270777" title="resolved fixed - the dialog font not apply to the argumentwizard">bug 270777</a></span> by enlarging the table font to make the table rows big enough for the icons/buttons. the fix is to use a listener on the table with swt.measureitem instead of changing the font size. fix applied to argumenttable (in both branch and trunk). fixed as described - with a listener which uses the row height requested by the rows.

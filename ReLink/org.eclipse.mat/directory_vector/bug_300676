improve information about available queries. null i have had a request from a user who wanted to understand what all those options (queries) are, including those sub menu items.  there are several aspects to this.  the query browser doesn't list all the queries, and the ui isn't ideal - there's no way to select with a mouse without invoking the query, it's hard to select all of one category etc..  the query browser isn't available from context menu.  some queries don't have help.  the html help doesn't have a queries reference. i've got some code to improve the query browser. good points.  i personally also like the ctrl-q functionality. it shows a popup where you can filter queries just by typing. we can improve here too, because on mac os x that currently maps to cmd-q which, of course, quits the application. i've put in some initial changes. once a filter is given then all the queries are displayed (with scroll bars if necessary). the 'all queries' button allows all queries to be browsed. the query browser now allows categories to be selected. double-click is required to run a query (because single click is needed to move to a query in a long list). command line usage is now displayed in the help (so that copying a query also finds in the list). the enum alternatives are displayed in this help. the query browser now can show all the queries, and appears with the context menu. i've updated individual query help text. the query argument wizard now shows the category in the title.  i'll raise concerns about the accelerator (ctrl-q) as a separate defect. 300676 300676 300676 300676

notesview changes. null notesview imports interface org.eclipse.ui.texteditor.iupdate which is uses for notesviewaction.  mat runs when this iupdate reference is removed. what is it really needed for?  if it can be removed then we don't need plug-in org.eclipse.ui.editors which saves about 500kb.  do we need to import plug-ins  org.eclipse.mat.ui org.eclipse.ui.console org.eclipse.ui.workbench  another problem: the line             if (text != null &amp;&amp; text.trim() != &quot;&quot;) looks suspicious as reference comparison is not good for strings. this might be intended             if (text != null &amp;&amp; !text.trim().equals(&quot;&quot;)) but what is the intention for an existing note file if the user deletes all the characters. should it leave the existing notes untouched on a save (strange), overwrite the file with no data or delete the file? presumably it should not create a file if no text is supplied. <span class="quote">&gt;another problem: the line &gt;            if (text != null &amp;&amp; text.trim() != &quot;&quot;) &gt;looks suspicious as reference comparison is not good for strings.</span >  you are right, the second check is not necessary at all.  iupdate is implemented to enable/disable context menu actions in notesview in sync with the user's activities. currently i check whether there are other ways to get the same functionality. since org.eclipse.ui.console was removed from the dependency list of org.eclipse.mat.ui i'm removing it also from the dependencies feature which holds all the necessary plugins for the mat rcp. after removing org.eclipse.ui.console will memory analyzer still start with -console (for the osgi console?) yes, it will still start with the (osgi-)console. the package org.eclipse.ui.console is related to the consoleview (from javadoc: &quot;the eclipse platform ui console plug-in provides a set of classes and interfaces to facilitate the creation and display of consoles in the consoleview&quot;). i just wondered why there is still a dependency to org.eclipse.ui.editors. as far as i can see there is no need for it anymore. everything compiles and the notes view is still usable. benjamin, agreed. there is no compile time dependency left, the only reference is an extension point &quot;org.eclipse.ui.editors&quot; which lives in another plug-in. erwin is on vacation this week. he'll look into it. dependency to org.eclipse.ui.editors successfully removed with changeset 405.

compositeresult doesn't display a spec or another compositeresult. null if a query returns a compositeresult containing a spec then the tab is blank apart from some text like  org.eclipse.mat.report.sectionspec&#64;5ebb5ebb  if a query returns a compositeresult containing another compositeresult marked as ashtml then the sub result is still expanded rather than being shown as html. the fix is to change queryexecution to expand those cases to html, rather as if they were the main result from a query. i have also added a test query. this isn't run a junit test as i don't know how.

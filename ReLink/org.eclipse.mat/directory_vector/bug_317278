org.eclipse.mat.ui.help contains empty src/org.eclipse.mat.ui folder. null there is no source at all in this plugin (as expected) but there is still an empty folder under src. this causes complaints about missing execution environment for the bundle. i'll remove the empty folder. see <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=316714" title="new - some brees missing for helios common repo bundles">bug 316714</a> should we also remove the javabuilder and apianalysisbuilder from the buildcommand and nature sections of the .project file? it was my misunderstanding. the complaint in <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=316714" title="new - some brees missing for helios common repo bundles">bug 316714</a> was that we do have execution environment specified in the help plugin, although there are no classes in it. i have removed it.  i also have removed the empty source folder.

dtfj adapter retains memory. null reported problem: the dtfj adapter can retain memory even when all dumps and memory analyzer windows are closed.  reason: dtfj images are expensive to open as they can require the unzipping of dumps or complex phd processing. the images are retained via a soft reference cache. if the heap got full then the cache entries would be freed, but if the user switches to another program then the heap will not be shrunk. solution: keep a count of dtfj images in use - then 30 seconds after the use count gets to zero clear the cache. this allows the user to reopen a dump shortly after closing it, but keeps memory usage down. the dtfj images are released 30 seconds after the last dtfj image is closed. this timer is cleared if a dump is opened within the 30 seconds. 299497 299497 299497 299497

junit tests leave temporary files around. null after running the junit tests a lot of junitnnnnnnnnn directories are left in the temporary files folder. this requires cleaning up regularly to avoid other problems when running out of disk space. some of the problem could be snapshots not being closed. the pristine snapshots are not retrieved from the cache, but are stored back in the cache so could be given to another test, which might be wrong as pristine snapshots could be build with unusual options. these should be stored separately (or else the tests should clean them up).  should snapshots have a finalizer?  if a copying a dump fails due to lack of disk space then we need to close the file and delete it. the test case code is now fixed - i think the remaining files are kept because of dtfj not cleaning up properly - see <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=333004" title="assigned - clear up dtfj image using close()">bug 333004</a> 333169 333169 333169 333169

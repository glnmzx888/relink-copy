improvements for the compare basket view. null the initial version of the compare basket view has to be improved. here the comments from <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=298078" title="assigned - comparison features in mat">bug 298078</a>:  the compare basket works quite well and is similar to, but more flexible than previous histogram comparison.  - it would be nice to delete a selection from the compare basket - should 'compare' only compare the selected items (if more than one selected)? - should the menu items be left justified? - the results items should also indicate the dump they are from - there isn't yet a context menu i submitted the improvements. comments inlined below:  <span class="quote">&gt;&gt; - it would be nice to delete a selection from the compare basket</span > added delete of one or several selected results  <span class="quote">&gt;&gt; - should 'compare' only compare the selected items (if more than one selected)?</span > i'd prefer comparing everything in the basket. now one has the possibility to delete unnecessary stuff.  <span class="quote">&gt;&gt; - should the menu items be left justified?</span > now i added icons to the menu items, and the menu doesn't look so odd. it's the standard view toolbar on the left side.  <span class="quote">&gt;&gt; - the results items should also indicate the dump they are from</span > added a second column showing the heap dump  <span class="quote">&gt;&gt; - there isn't yet a context menu</span > added context menu with the context sensitive actions -&gt; move up/down, remove 305150 305150 305150 305150

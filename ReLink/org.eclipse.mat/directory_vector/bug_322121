default size of column in acquire dialog is too small. null build identifier: .0  the column for pid is a bit too small, it only shows 4 digit pids fully, 5 digit ones are cut off.   this is annoying as i need to manually enlarge the column width every time i open the dialog as the adjusted size is also not saved between invocations of the dialog.  reproducible: always thanks for the feedback! this one is easy to fix. i just gave it a try and doubled the width. once i enlarged the field i figured out that it is left aligned, which doesn't look well for an integer field, so i change also the alignment.   will submit the changes today. as this is a rather small change, i'll add it also to our .1 service release we're just building. i submitted my changes:  888 to fix it in /trunk 889 to fix this in /branches/.x  the .1 service release should be published soon (next weeks).

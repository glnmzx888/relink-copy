dtfjparser retries opening bad dumps. null if the dtfj parser is given a bad dump it can attempt to open it 3 or more times.  this is because after trying to open a dump with and without a metadata file, it has a final go at opening the dump without a metadata file.  also, a parser is added to the parser list for each file extension that matches. dtfj-j9 has .dmp.zip and .zip as file extensions, so abc.dmp.zip gets the dtfj-j9 parser twice. this is unnecessary. fix dtfjindexbuilder to build a list of files to try (without duplicates) and parserregistry to only add a parser once. now fixed as described.

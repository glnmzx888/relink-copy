run report fails with spaces in report xml directory names. null error message:  no unflagged arguments available  org.eclipse.mat.ui.actions.runregisteredreportaction.run() needs to protect the filename ready for parsing.  perhaps the error message should be better. we could use converters.convertandescape to protect the special characters.  convertandescape needs enhancing to cope with backslashes.  e.g. query history doesn't work with find_strings looking for one backslash.  also, it doesn't cope with other whitespace characters.  single backslashes don't need escaping, but two do, or \&quot;  e.g. \\machine\resource\file.xml  needs converting to  \\\machine\resource\file.xml  as the tokenize will convert \\\ to \\  we could convert it to   \\\\machine\\resource\\file.xml  but that might be more confusing to users?  c:\documents and settings\administrator\my documents\report.xml to &quot;c:\documents and settings\administrator\my documents\report.xml&quot;  rather than &quot;c:\\documents and settings\\administrator\\my documents\\report.xml&quot; i've updated converters.convertandescape  i've also changed the command line messages for bad queries slightly:  no unflagged parameters available for argument 'abc'  query 'unreachable objects histogram' has no argument 'abc'  missing value for argument 'pattern' ( -pattern )   find_strings with a pattern of \\ gets stored in the history as  find_strings -pattern \\\  so that the tokenizer removes one backslash, passing the remaining two to the regular expression parser.

notesview adds dispose listener to one widget then removes it from another. null in createpartcontrol(composite), a disposelistener is added to the provided parent composite.  in dispose(), the listener is then removed from the part site's shell.  the two controls are _not_ the same. there is no point in removing the listener from the shell because the shell didn't even have the listener in the first place. also, the listeners are effectively destroyed/unreferenced when the widget is disposed so there really is no need for your code to even bother removing the listener. thanks for the report. we could save the parent in the constructor, then check for !isdisposed() before doing the remove. it does appear that the parent composite has already been disposed, so it is too late to remove the dispose listener, so there isn't any point in doing the remove. i'll just remove it with a comment. i've removed the removedisposelistener call. how did you spot the error? have you seen other problems?

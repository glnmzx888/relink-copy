use urlimagedescriptor to load images. null just a minor thing i noticed: memoryanalyserplugin loads images itself from a url. you can use urlimagedescriptor to save some code and get rid of the error handling.  and btw: missing_image.gif is missing ;-) created <span class=""><a href="attachment.cgi?id=173223&amp;action=diff" name="attach_173223" title="patch">attachment 173223</a> <a href="attachment.cgi?id=173223&amp;action=edit" title="patch">[details]</a></span> patch  patch good idea - thanks.  to follow the eclipse legal process, please can you confirm that you (a) wrote 100% of the code;  (b) that you have the right to contribute the code to eclipse;  and that it is contributed under the eclipse public license.  for part c, the file has already has license header, but i'll add your name as a contributor. (c) the file header contains the appropriate license header. a) yep b) yep c) thanks  but i don't think i need to answer all these things as committer. i think only non-committers need to do that. i've applied and committed the patch.  i think the committer status is on a project basis, so in the eclipse legal process poster, figure 1 says &quot;written 100% by submitting committer or committer on same project under the supervision of the pmc&quot;, figure 3 says &quot;written 100% by submitting contributor (non-committer) and submitted under the terms of the project license (typically epl)&quot;.

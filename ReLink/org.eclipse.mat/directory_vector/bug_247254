while opening head dump, mat deletes files it does not own. null when opening a .hprof heap dump, mat will apparently delete files that it has not created itself. for example, i have a heap dump called 'mytest.hprof', and a  related logging file for this heap dump called 'mytest.log'. when i open the heap dump file, mat will delete the mytest.log file. this is very unexpected behaviour. during parsing, files named &lt;heapdump&gt;.inbound.index&lt;number&gt;.log are created. if parsing fails, those file could stay around. therefore they are deleted. but the pattern &lt;heapdump&gt;.*\.log includes too many files.  will fix asap.  i am sorry if you permanently lost the log file. submitted fix with change list 145.  next update to the download page will include fix. 247254 247254 247254 247254

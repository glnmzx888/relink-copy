it is not possible to set the sorting column of trees and tables in mat using keyboard. null changing the sorting column and direction for the table and tree results in mat is essential for the effective troubleshooting. currently this is not possible to be performed via a keyboard. as i wasn't sure if there is a standard way to do this i asked in the swt forum: <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=msg&amp;th=165230&amp;start=0">http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=msg&amp;th=165230&amp;start=0</a>&amp;  the answer is that there is no standard way. we should add this possibility to the context menus on the displayed results. i moved all the columns related context menus under a common node &quot;columns...&quot; and added there &quot;sort by&quot;. the latter gives the possibility to change the sorting column. selecting the already selected sorting column will change the sort direction. 307396 307396 307396 307396

fix in sorting. due to ineffective partitioning of the sorted array (as part of a quick sort) it was possible to run into stackoverflowerror. this happened only in case there were many equal elements in the array, and the length of the array is more than 5 million (for smaller arrays a radix sort is  used). ---- modified : /trunk/plugins/org.eclipse.mat.api/src/org/eclipse/mat/collect/arrayutils.java   (stack o verflow error ) (array utils ) 28 28 28 28

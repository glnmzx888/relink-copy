improve the api for looking up a query. null the queries in mat are not part of the public api. this should stay like this for now. however, it may be useful to have a way to lookup a query (and there is a way), set its parameters and execute it. the org.eclipse.mat.snapshot.query.snapshotquery class provides such api. it however doesn't expose methods for inspecting the annotations of the query and the annotated parameters.     the snapshotquery class has to be enriched with methods giving meta data about the parameters a query expect, as well as getting the annotations for the query like help, icon, etc...   it should be made clear in the javadoc that the mat queries are not part of the api and their names, classes and parameters may change i have committed some changes which:   expose as api two read only descriptors for annotated parameters and annotated objects (with help, icon, etc...). these are in the report plugin,  org.eclipse.mat.query.annotations.descriptors    added the following methods to the snapshotquery class in the .api plugin     public list&lt;? extends iargumentdescriptor&gt; getarguments()     public iannotatedobjectdescriptor getdescriptor()    deprecated the snapshotquery.set() method and added an equivalent snapshotquery.setargument() just to have consistent naming (snapshot query ) (snapshot query ) (snapshot query ) (i argument descriptor ) (i annotated object descriptor ) (snapshot query ) (snapshot query ) 309818 309818 309818 309818

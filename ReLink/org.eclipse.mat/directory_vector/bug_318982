improve oql documentation for properties accessors. null <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=msg&amp;th=171263&amp;start=0">http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=msg&amp;th=171263&amp;start=0</a>&amp; the help system states that it's possible to call methods through reflection  quote:  calling java methods  [ &lt;alias&gt; . ] &#64;&lt;method&gt;( [ &lt;expression&gt;, &lt;expression&gt; ] ) ...  adding ( ) forces oql to interpret this as a java method call. the call is executed via reflection. common java methods.    but i can't get it working. for example, this is the result when trying to call gettime() from the java.util.date  quote:  executed query: select d.&#64;gettime() from java.util.date d  problem reported: method gettime not found in object java.util.date [id=0x647cd5e8]    the same happens with all methods that don't belong to the java.lang.object class.  am i doing something wrong or is this feature not supported yet?  thx!   shows a misunderstanding of properties accessors, which operate on the memory analyzer model objects, not the actual objects. the help needs to be improved, with links to the model api doc. i've updated propertiesaccessors.dita and propertiesaccessors.html 318982 318982 318982 318982

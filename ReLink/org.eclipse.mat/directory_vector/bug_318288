the parseheapdump script doesn't run on aix. null the parseheapdump doesn't run.  ksh: /tmp/memoryanalyzer/parseheapdump.sh:  not found.   the problem seems to be cr/lf not lf in the script. i've removed the cr/lf by changing the svn:mime-type to text/plain, then locally renaming the file to parseheapdump.sh.txt, then file-&gt;convert line delimiters-&gt;unix, then renamed the file back to parseheapdump.sh i've created a parseheapdump2.sh script for aix which will run with 32-bit and 64-bit java. does it make sense to have both files included in the rcp? i think it will be better to give to the user only one script which is working on the platform. or did i interpret wrongly the build.properties file? the existing parseheapdump.sh script runs on aix with 32-bit java.  is it better to use this script which will also use memoryanalyzer.ini for heap size, and other parameters the same as the gui version etc. <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/memoryanalyzer/faq#out_of_memory_error_while_running_the_memory_analyzer">http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/memoryanalyzer/faq#out_of_memory_error_while_running_the_memory_analyzer</a>  or to always use the new parseheapdump2.sh script (renamed to parseheapdump.sh) on aix? i would say either rename  parseheapdump2.sh to  parseheapdump.sh and use only it, or rename  parseheapdump2.sh to  parseheapdump64.sh and keep both. i just didn't like the 2 at the end, as it tells nothing about when to use this script. i've just put one script for aix which should run with 32-bit and 64-bit java.

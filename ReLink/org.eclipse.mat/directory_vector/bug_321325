remove "beta" from the name of the bundle registry query. null the bundle registry query is available for quite some time now. so far we haven't got any complaints about it, and i think it doesn't deserve the &quot;beta&quot; in the name. i'll remove this. the affected file is /org.eclipse.mat.api/src/org/eclipse/mat/inspections/osgi/annotations.properties i changed a week ago in branches/.x and trunk 321325 321325 321325 321325

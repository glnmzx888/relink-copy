not possible to traverse the overview pane with the tab key. null it is not possible to traverse the overviewpane using the tab key. after &quot;biggest objects retained by size&quot; the tab key doesn't work any longer. neither the arrow keys do. going back is also not possible. i added a traverselistener to the canvas which was used (svn revision  . now using the tab key one can go through the whole overview page.  i'm not quite sure that going through the chart and the text below it makes much sense, but this is what i achieved at my first go. my second attempt gave better results. now the tab navigation inside the overview page works as i have expected it to be. closing the bug as it was fixed with svn revision 598 (overview pane ) (traverse listener ) 306803 306803 306803 306803

can't select individual table and tree entries with keyboard. null on windows the usual way of selecting entries with the keyboard is with control-up arrow and down arrow then space.  for the tree and table viewers this doesn't work as the search-on-typing box comes up on typing space.  also, ordinary tables and trees use a typed letter to jump to and entry with that letter. this isn't so important though. the simplest fix is to searchontyping to ignore a space character when deciding to bring up the search box. space is now used for selection, not to bring up search on typing.

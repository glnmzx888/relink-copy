schema definitions have errors. null several of the exsd files have   &lt;appinfo&gt; elements rather than &lt;appinfo&gt;  this causes an error when i attempt to view the files in eclipse  and some such as org.eclipse.mat.api schema/factory.exsd  don't display the &lt;factory&gt; &lt;impl&gt; implements information if this &lt;appinfo&gt; element is not fixed.  should all the exsd files have &lt;appinfo&gt; elements? thanks andrew. the schema files have been create via copy &amp; paste and need a thorough clean up (and some documentation). i'll look into that. fixes checked in with cl 188.  note: if you use the ganymede schema editor, it will automatically change it back to lowercase &quot;appinfo&quot;..!?! 253178 253178 253178 253178

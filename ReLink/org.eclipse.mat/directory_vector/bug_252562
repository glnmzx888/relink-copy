oql removes keyword objects removed from query. null when executing the following query in the oql window, the second &quot;objects&quot; keywords is removed when printing the query to the navigation history and the input field.   select classof(out).getname(), classof(out) from objects ( select objects ${snapshot}.getoutboundreferentids(thread.getobjectid()) from org.apache.tomcat.util.threads.threadwithattributes thread  ) out where (classof(out).getname()=&quot;java.security.accesscontrolcontext&quot;)  the problem occurs only if the query is nested into an out select statement. strange. this can be fixed by modifying query.java to output the &quot;objects &quot; keyword if selectclause.asobjects is true.  i've made the change. (thread with attributes ) (access control context ) 252562 252562 252562 252562

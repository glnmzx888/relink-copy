no jvminfo in heap dump details pane. null build id: .100  steps to reproduce: 1.start mat 2.window - heap dump history 3.click on a previous heap dump  the jvm info is not displayed for the dump. with previous builds it used to be. now it is replaced by the heap dump format.   more information: the 'format' row used to have information such as the vm version. this was useful when looking at several dumps and deciding which was the appropriate one to reload.  now it just has the internal dump type identifier, and that doesn't appear until the dump is reloaded. to be honest i don't remember what was previously there. i looked at this today, and figured out that xsnapshotinfo.setjvminfo() is called only from the dtfj adapter, i.e. for .hprof we don't call it at all. what appers right now as &quot;format&quot; is the id of the parser, e.g. hprof.  what you expected to see there is rather something like: ibm jvm 1.x.y ... right?  just let me know what was the expected / previous behaviour and i'll try to figure out when and why the change happened. jvm version disappeared in revision 250, 16 january 2009 of snapshotoutlinepage.java the format (hprof, dtfj-j9, etc) line also isn't saved in the history. this is because a copy of the snapshotinfo is made for the history without the properties. we need to add this $heapformat property too. fixes check in - also copy the $heapformat property when creating a snapshot history entry, and display the version as &quot;jvm version&quot;.  hprof files don't have a convenient version from the dump. it might be possible to assemble a version from the system properties but that could be complicated, and would have to be done from a query like the system overview.
